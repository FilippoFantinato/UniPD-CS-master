\section{Multi-class classification tasks}

As regarding multi-class classification tasks, we can take as an example the classification of animals in an image or, to be more specific, the exact species of each animal. Furthermore, we can think about weather forecasts and the classification of what kind of day is, so through some data about humidity, wind and temperature, the task is to classify if itâ€™s going to be a rainy, sunny or cloudy day. \\

One possible hypothesis space for multi-class classification tasks could be hyperplanes in $R^k$, where $k$ is the number of classes that can be used during the classification problem.
