\section{Binary classification tasks}

Examples of binary classification tasks can be all those that are related to say if something belongs to a category or if not, for instance we can take a task where we have to classify if given an image of a fruit, that fruit is a peach or not. In this case we will assign the value +1, if in the image there is a peach, or -1 if there isnâ€™t. Another significant example can be the spam detection, where we have to classify if an email is spam or not. \\

As a hypothesis space, in this case, we can consider hyperplanes in $R^{2}$, circles, rectangles and D2 forms, where points inside that specific form are classified in a way and points outside in another way.
