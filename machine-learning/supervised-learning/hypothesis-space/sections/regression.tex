\section{Regression tasks}

To stick with the weather forecast example, a possible regression task could be the prediction of how much humidity there will be a day in the future given a certain wind speed, by analyzing old data on wind speed in relation to humidity. \\

The hypothesis space for regression tasks depends on the type of regression that you are going to use, because for linear regression it’s limited to linear function and for polynomial regression it’s limited to all possible polynomial functions of degree $K$ (degree that you have chosen).
